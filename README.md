## Reflections:

### 🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I've achieved all the base requirements and a couple of stretch goal requirements.

### 🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

I did not attempt the two stretch goals requirements where the user could delete posts and the one where they could like a post. Did not attempt because I spent quite a lot of time on the look and feel of the website that I was trying to achieve.Althought I would like to revist this at some point to add those stretch goal functionalities.

### 🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Did not have time to delve into this and explore this yet. I will explore this later.

### What went really well and what could have gone better?

I think I have almost achieved the look and feel I was envisioning for this project. Although it can be a lot better and certain elements can be improved upon.

### Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials):

For this I refered to the DI003 github repo where Frankie during the week had demonstrated how most of the requirements can be met. In addition to that, the external resource I used was Chat GPT. I also used the Google fonts API to fetch the Lora font which would go with the theme I was aiming for. I learnt this through a bit of googling and guidance from ChatGPT.

### Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment:

I struggled quite a lot with the styling so I spent a good chunk of time with ChatGPT for guidance on the CSS side of the code. I eventually scrapped my CSS and then got ChatGPT to help with the CSS side of things. I also struggled a bit with displaying the retrieved form elements properly on the page, I took guidance from ChatGPT for that and updated the main.js side of things. Server side of things was straightforward. Deployment had a few issues where render wasn't deploying my main.js file. I resolved it by changing the publish directory and also moved the main.js file out of the nested SRC folder.
